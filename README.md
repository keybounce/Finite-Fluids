# Finite-Fluids
Fork of "Realistic Flowing Fluids", from 4HeadTiger (previously on bitbucket)

This mod adds finite, flowing lava and water to Minecraft. 
This means that existing minecraft "infinite pools" will no longer be infinite, and "waterfalls" (single source blocks of water on hills) will drain.
An optional, simple rainfall system is implemented to restore water to low biomes (rivers/swamps/etc) during rain.

Performance: Right now, rainfall is slow, the rest is fast.
A more complex rainfall system will eventually happen.

NB: Falling blocks (sand, gravel, etc) will displace/push liquids up.
Pistons are *supposed to*, but are not tested in this version (they worked in 4Head's original)
